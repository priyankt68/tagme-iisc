Machine learning programming contest by CSA, IISc, Bangalore

Problem Description
===================

The contest will be declared open during the Machine Learning event presentation on February 28, 2014. After the event has been declared open, the datasets (first two) will be available for download. We have three different datasets:

    1. Training data consisting of {image_id, image, category label}
    2. Validation data consisting of {image_id, image}. The participating team can upload the output labels produced by their algorithm corresponding to this validation data. The scores will be displayed immediately to assist the team to evaluate themselves.
    3. Test data consisting of {image_id, image}. This data will be published only on the day of final submission and not before that. The performance of the model on this test data only will be used for judging winners.
